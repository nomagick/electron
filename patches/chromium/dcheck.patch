Subject: dcheck.patch

This disables some debug checks which currently fail when running the Electron
test suite. In general there should be sustained effort to have all debug checks
enabled. If you want to help, choose one of the diffs below and remove it. Then
build Electron (debug configuration) and make sure all tests pass on the CI
systems. Unfortunately the tests don't always cover the check failures, so it's
good to also run some non-trivial Electron app to verify.

Apart from getting rid of a whole diff, you may also be able to replace one diff
with another which enables at least some of the previously disabled checks. For
example, the checks might be disabled for a whole build target, but actually
only one or two specific checks fail. Then it's better to simply comment out the
failing checks and allow the rest of the target to have them enabled.
